<p>Third-year bachelor student at <a href="https://kpi.ua/en">Kyiv Polytechnic National University</a>, Faculty of Informatics and Computer Science, as a Computer Engineer (spec. 123 - Computer systems and networks).</p>
<p>I study remotely, therefore can work full-time.</p>
<p>Looking forward to gaining relevant work experience with high-level languages (primarily C#, but would also like to gain the opportunity to work with Python or Java).</p>
<p>Have a good understanding of C#, SQL and CosmosDB databases due to working with it while creating a pet project during studies at TechFabric School.</p>
<p>Interested in sites and software development, primarily as a Back-End developer.</p>
